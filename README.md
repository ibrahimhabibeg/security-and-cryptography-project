# Implementation of Various Cryptography Algorithms

This project implements multiple encryption and decryption algorithms discussed during the Security and Cryptography course (CSC 302; 2025-2026) at [Suez Canal University](https://suez.edu.eg/ar/en/).

The implemented algorithms are:

- Caesar Cipher
- Playfair Cipher
- Vigenere Cipher
- Autokey Cipher
- Rail Fence Cipher
- DES (Data Encryption Standard)

Each algorithm is implemented in its own file in the `algorithms` directory. The main application is built using Streamlit.

You can see the project run on Streamlit Cloud [here](https://ibrahim-habib-security-and-cryptography-project.streamlit.app/).

You can run the project locally by installing the required dependencies and executing `main.py` with Streamlit:

```bash
uv sync
uv run streamlit run main.py
```
